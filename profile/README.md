## The Singularity and You
Are you an up-and-coming programmer with no definition of ethics? Do you have a poster of Vitalik Buterin on your wall? Has life ceased to provide you with any enjoyment? We want **you** working 100 hours a week [for us](https://www.fbijobs.gov/). We're also a family, meaning we'll guilt trip you into taking as few days off as possible :)
